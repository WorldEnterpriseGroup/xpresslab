### 3. **Find an Issue that Matches Your Interest**
Continue browsing the Issues Tab _(Tab 3)_ to find an issue suitable for your skills and interests on the newly opened tab. 
This chart below describes a few of our most common issue types:
- $\color{orange}{media}$ $\color{orange}{content}$ - Visual and Audio Content including Graphics, Commercials, Sound Bytes, etc
- $\color{BurntOrange}{content}$ $\color{BurntOrange}{writing}$ - Long Form Writing that engages, motivates, and potentially converts users to take action
- $\color{yellow}{copywriting}$ - Short Form Writing text for advertising and marketing
- $\color{violet}{good}$ $\color{violet}{first}$ $\color{violet}{issue}$ - Good for newcomers
- $\color{green}{help}$ $\color{green}{wanted}$ - Extra attention is needed - great for external contributors
- $\color{lightblue}{documentation}$ - Improvements or additions to documentation

### 4. **Project Discovery**
If the entire project has been put in motion well, then there will be a master Readme.md file explaining what this project is with proper links on it. Also, if the person who made the issue you chose tried really hard, then they will have supplied a lot of links and instructions right in the issue.  That is usually not the case.  Usually, you're going to have to try really hard to really understand what the issue is even referring to.  This means you will need to do **Project Discovery** to see if you will have fun and can even comprehend the issue you've chosen.  If it doesn't make sense, you can always comment and ask for clarification before you start an issue & ask the manager to communicate better.<br>
To tackle Project Discovery yourself, do the following:
   1. On the Issue Page, Ctrl-Click the `<> Code` Button in the upper-left area of the Issue you have chosen.
   2. Right-Click the newly created GitHub Code Browser _(Tab 4)_
   3. Choose "Duplicate Tab" which will make a new GitHub Code Browser _(Tab 5)_
   4. If Possible, click the `master` Button and click on **gh-pages** in the selected options (Sometimes not available)
   5. Search the Readme.md to find out the website link.
   6. Either Ctrl-Click the Website link, or open a new tab and browse to it if it's not clickable. _(Tab 6)_
   
### 5. **Prepare Your Workspace**
You should now have 6 Tabs total that hold together your entire workspace. Take a pause at this point to make sure you are organized with the following tabs:
1. Search Engine
2. This Guide
3. GitHub Issues Page
4. GitHub Code Browser
5. GitHub Code Browser #2
6. Website of Project

### 6. **Understand the Issue**
   Next, you will toggle between all the tabs above multiple times so you can get a good understanding of the issue you chose and interact with the issue until the issue is fully known and comprehensive. This process is known as [Requirement Engineering](https://www.educba.com/requirement-engineering/) (RE). Here are a few common steps great engineers practice for really powerful RE.
   1. Open the Website _(Tab 6)_
   2. Browse around and make yourself comfortable
   3. Tab Back-and-forth between the website & the issue _(Tabs 3 & 6)_
   4. Use the Search Engine to research the topic if you need further help. _(Tab 1)_
   5. If you have questions or need clarification, then write a comment in the issue area _(Tab 3)_
   6. You may also want to add your links you are researching in the comment section to help others who are working on this same issue. _(Tab 3)_
   7. Repeat Steps 1-7 until you are extremely confident that you can move forward.

      > __Warning__ You MUST continue to Step 8 within 2 hours, otherwise your updates might conflict with others who are working on this same issue!

### 8. **Save Your Changes**

      - Keep Note of your Issue #. 
   3. Go to the GWE Area _(Tab 5)_
   4. Click on the Source Control Icon (or Press Ctrl-Shift-G)

      > 1. Click on the GitHub Pull Request (PR) Button <br>
      > 2. Click "Create New Pull Request..." <br>
      > 3. Change the "Into" Area so it is pointing you to the right branch. <br>

      > 5. Write a Description of what you are changing and why. <br>
      > 6. Click the "Create" button to finalize your Pull Request (PR) <br>
      > <br>
      > The system will remember your selection, so be careful what you choose.<br>
      > You will need to return to the main branch in lower-left of screen if you do change<br>
